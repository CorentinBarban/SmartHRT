calculate_recovery_time:
  name: Calculate Recovery Time
  description: >
    Calculates the heating recovery start time based on thermal parameters 
    (RCth, RPth) and current temperatures.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).
      required: false
      example: "abc123"
      selector:
        text:

calculate_recovery_update_time:
  name: Calculate Recovery Update Time
  description: >
    Calculates when the next recovery time update should occur.
    This is used to schedule periodic recalculations before the heating starts.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).
      required: false
      example: "abc123"
      selector:
        text:

calculate_rcth_fast:
  name: Calculate RCth Fast
  description: >
    Calculates the dynamic evolution of RCth (thermal time constant) 
    before the heating recovery starts. This tracks temperature decay 
    during the heating-off period.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).
      required: false

      selector:
        text:

on_heating_stop:
  name: On Heating Stop
  description: >
    Call this service when the heating stops. It records the current 
    interior and exterior temperatures and timestamps for thermal 
    constant calculations.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).

      selector:
        text:

on_recovery_start:
  name: On Recovery Start
  description: >
    Call this service at the start of heating recovery. It records 
    temperatures, calculates RCth, and enables RPth calculation mode.
