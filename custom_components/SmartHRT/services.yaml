calculate_recovery_time:
  name: Calculate Recovery Time
  description: >
    Calculates the heating recovery start time based on thermal parameters 
    (RCth, RPth) and current temperatures.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).
      required: false
      example: "abc123"

        text:

calculate_recovery_update_time:
  name: Calculate Recovery Update Time
  description: >
    Calculates when the next recovery time update should occur.
    This is used to schedule periodic recalculations before the heating starts.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).
      required: false

calculate_rcth_fast:
  name: Calculate RCth Fast
  description: >
    Calculates the dynamic evolution of RCth (thermal time constant) 
    before the heating recovery starts. This tracks temperature decay 
    during the heating-off period.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).

on_heating_stop:
  name: On Heating Stop
  description: >
    Call this service when the heating stops. It records the current 
    interior and exterior temperatures and timestamps for thermal 
    constant calculations.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).

      selector:
        text:

on_recovery_start:
  name: On Recovery Start
  description: >
    Call this service at the start of heating recovery. It records 
    temperatures, calculates RCth, and enables RPth calculation mode.
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).
      required: false
      example: "abc123"
      selector:
        text:

on_recovery_end:
  name: On Recovery End
  description: >
    Call this service at the end of heating recovery (when target temperature 
    is reached or target hour is reached). It records temperatures and 
    calculates RPth (thermal power constant).
  fields:
    entry_id:
      name: Entry ID
      description: The config entry ID (optional, uses first available if not specified).
      required: false
      example: "abc123"
      selector:
        text:

reset_learning:
  name: Reset Learning
  description: >
    Resets all learned thermal coefficients (RCth, RPth and their wind variants) 
    to their default values (50). Use this service if the learned values have 
    become inaccurate, for example after home modifications or insulation changes.
    The reset values are also persisted to storage.

trigger_calculation:
  name: Trigger Calculation
  description: >
    Manually triggers an immediate recalculation of the recovery time. 
    Useful after changing parameters to see the effect immediately 
    without waiting for the next scheduled calculation.
